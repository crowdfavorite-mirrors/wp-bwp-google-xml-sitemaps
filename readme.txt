A WordPress XML Sitemap plugin that comes with support for Sitemap Index,
Multi-site and Google News sitemap. Image sitemap is supported, too.

== Description ==

With BWP GXS you will no longer have to worry about the 50,000 URL limit or the
time it takes for a sitemap to be generated. This plugin is fast, consumes much
less resource and can be extended via your very own modules (yes, no hooks
needed!). Here's a [demo](http://betterwp.net/sitemapindex.xml) of the sitemap
index if you are interested.

= Google News Sitemap =

Add a *Google News sitemap* to your sitemap index easily. News sitemap can be
used to ping search engines individually if you want. And of course, whenever
you publish a new post in a news category, all selected search engines will be
pinged.

*As of 1.4.0, you can use custom post types and custom taxonomies for your news
sitemap.*

= Image Sitemap =

If you have any post (of any post type) that supports the *Featured image*
feature, you will be able to add the current featured image to a post-based
sitemap with ease.

This feature is available since 1.4.0.

= Sitemap Index =

A sitemap index, as its name suggests, is a sitemap that allows you to group
several sitemaps inside it.

It gives you many benefits such as: possibility to bypass the 50,000 URL limit
(for example you can have 10 custom sitemaps, each has 10,000 URLs), or
possibility to make the generation time much faster (because each sitemap is
requested separately and is built by its own module), etc.

For a search engine to acknowledge your sitemaps, you only have to submit the
sitemap index and you're done, no need to submit each sitemap individually.

= Splitting post-based sitemaps =

As of version 1.1.0, this plugin can automatically split large post sitemaps
into smaller ones when limit reached. For example if you have 200K posts and
would like to have 10K posts for each sitemap, BWP GXS will then split `post.xml`
into 20 parts (i.e. from `post_part1.xml` to `post_part20.xml`).

This not only helps you bypass the 50,000 URLs limit without having to build
your custom modules, but also helps make your sitemaps smaller, lighter, and of
course faster to generate. This plugin has been tested on sites that have
nearly 200K posts and it took less than 1 second to generate the sitemap index.

Furthermore, you can set a separate limit for split sitemaps or simply use the
global limit.

= Multi-site compatible =

Each website within your network will have its own sitemap index and sitemaps.

For sub-domain installation, your sitemap index will appear at `http://sub-domain.example.com/sitemapindex.xml`.
For sub-folder installation, your sitemap index will appear at `http://example.com/sub-folder/sitemapindex.xml`.

There's always a sitemap index for your main site, available at `http://example.com/sitemapindex.xml`.

If you choose the sub-domain approach, each sub-domain can also have its own `robots.txt`.

= Custom sitemaps using modules =

The unrivaled flexibility this plugin offers is the ability to define your
custom sitemaps using modules. Each module is a actually .php file that tell
BWP Google XML Sitemap how to build a sitemap file. You can extend default
modules or create completely new ones.

This plugin also comes with a convenient base class for developing modules with
easy to use and thoroughly documented API. Since modules can be defined by you,
there's no limitation what a sitemap can have (for example you can bypass the
50,000 URL limit, as stated above). There's one limitation, though: your
imagination ;). Oh, did I mention that you can even use module to create
another sitemap index?

= 1.4.0 (2016-01-14) =

For a quick overview of all the changes, take a look at this article instead:
http://betterwp.net/bwp-google-xml-sitemaps-1-4-0-released/

-   **New Features**
    -   Add a "News age" setting to allow more control over the Google News
        sitemap's contents. See
        <http://betterwp.net/wordpress-plugins/google-xml-sitemaps/faq/#google-news-age>
        for more info.
    -   Allow excluding posts by terms. If a post belongs to several terms, it
        will be excluded if any of those terms is excluded.
    -   Add a new filter hook `bwp_gxs_external_sitemaps` that can be used to
        add non-BWP sitemaps to the sitemap index. Read
        [here](http://betterwp.net/wordpress-plugins/google-xml-sitemaps/#external-sitemaps)
        for more info.
    -   Add featured image to existing post-based sitemaps.
        -   To enable this feature, go to **BWP Sitemaps > Extensions** and
            choose to enable the "Google Image Sitemap" extension, and select
            post type(s) to enable the extension for.
        -   This feature is enabled automatically for the Google News sitemap
            if the news post type has the "Google Image Sitemap" extension
              enabled for it.
        -   As a related change for this new feature, Google News sitemap is
            now part of **BWP Sitemap > Extensions** as well.
    -   Add ability to use custom post types and taxonomies for the Google News
        sitemap.
    -   Allow regenerating individual sitemap via admin page.
    -   Allow adding non-WordPress pages via **BWP Sitemaps > XML Sitemaps >
        External Pages**.
    -   Allow excluding posts/terms via **BWP Sitemaps > XML Sitemaps > Exclude
        items**.
-   **Enhancements**
    -   Disable some inputs when they are overridden via codes and display
        overridden values instead.
    -   Make "Frequency", "Priority" and "Last modified" optional when
        adding/updating external pages.
    -   Handle last modified datetime of non-post items more consistently.
-   **Other Changes**
    -   Update language template file. If you're a translator, please help
        translating this plugin! For more info, see:
        <http://betterwp.net/wordpress-tips/create-pot-file-using-poedit/>
    -   Mark as compatible with WordPress 4.4+. Now require at least WordPress
        3.6 and PHP 5.2.0.
    -   Choosing which post types/taxonomies to generate sitemaps for is now an
        opt-out setting. Instead of choosing which post types/taxonomies to
        disable sitemap generation, you would now choose post types/taxonomies
        whose sitemaps should be generated.
    -   Display an error message when enabling the Google News sitemap but it
        can not be generated.
    -   Make it more obvious to check and generate the Sitemap Index when
        needed.
        -   If no sitemap has been generated yet, a button to generate the
            Sitemap Index will be shown.
        -   The "Clear All Logs" button have been moved to the "Sitemap Log"
            tab, and renamed to "Clear Message Log". Clicking on that button
            will now clear the message log only, leaving the sitemap log
            untouched. The sitemap log is expected to be improved in version
            2.0.0.
    -   Disable indexing of sitemaps using the X-Robots-Tag: noindex header.

    -   XSLT stylesheet is now disabled by default.
-   **Bugs fixed**
    -  Fix a bug that causes post.xml to be included in sitemap index even when
       explicitly excluded.
    -  Fix a bug that causes the sitemap index to be empty when post-splitting
       is not enabled.
    -  Filter out urls whose protocols do not match the current protocol.
       -   When SSL is not used, all HTTPS urls will be filtered out.
       -   When SSL is used, all HTTP urls will be filtered out.
    -  Fix a bug that makes it not possible to flush the default cache
       directory. The cause was we cached the cache directory in the
       `BWP_Sitemaps::$cache_directory` object, which was not updated correctly
       when flushing cache.
    -  Fix a bug that could lead to custom post types being included in
       post.xml sitemap.
    -  Fix a bug in the Google News sitemap that leads to duplicate posts when
       posts are assigned to multiple categories.
    -  Fix a bug that generate duplicate terms when some terms are excluded.
    -  Use UTC timezone when looking for google news posts.

= 1.3.1 =
    * Marked as WordPress 4.0 compatible.
    * Added `bwp_gxs_excluded_posts` filter hook to page sitemap module. It should be possible to use an array of page ids to exclude certain pages from the page sitemap.
    * Added a `News name` setting (in *XML Sitemaps >> Google News Sitemap*).
    * Other minor fixes and enhancements.

= 1.3.0 =
* **New features**
    * Added a new setting to control which post types can be used to ping search engines
    * Added a ping limit setting
    * Added a "Save changes and Flush cache" button

* **Enhancements**
    * Plugin's admin areas have been re-organized to be easier to use.
    * Updated all sitemap modules with easier to use APIs.
    * Last modified dates are now more properly handled.
    * Error log has been refined to be more friendly and useful.
    * Post types that do not have any post should not be listed in `sitemapindex.xml` by default.
    * Posts that are password-protected should not be listed in sitemap files.
    * Be more selective when pinging search engines, this is to avoid double pinging when using plugin like Snitch.
    * Replaced the "Clean PHP errors" function with a "Debug extra" mode that can be used to easily debug "Content Encoding error" and similar errors, more info about "Debug extra" [here](http://betterwp.net/wordpress-plugins/google-xml-sitemaps/#sitemap_log_debug).
    * When debug or debug extra is on, `no-cache` headers are sent to ensure a proper debugging environment.
    * Caching is now disabled by default to avoid confusion when setting up the sitemapindex.
    * Cache directory can now be edited via:
        * Plugin's admin area: *BWP Sitemaps >> XML Sitemaps >> Caching*
        * PHP Constant: e.g. `define('BWP_GXS_CACHE_DIR', 'path/to/cache/directory');`
        * Filters: use `bwp_gxs_cache_dir`
    * Added `bwp_gxs_excluded_posts` filter hook to let users exclude posts using an array of IDs instead of an SQL string. This is meant to replace `bwp_gxs_post_where` filter hook when using to exclude certain posts. More info [here](http://betterwp.net/wordpress-plugins/google-xml-sitemaps/#exclude_items).
    * Added `bwp_gxs_excluded_terms` filter hook as a taxonomy-equivalent to `bwp_gxs_excluded_posts`, this works the same as (and deprecates) `bwp_gxs_term_exclude`.
    * Added `bwp_gxs_sitemap_lastmod` filter hook to let users modify last modified dates of sitemaps inside a sitemapindex programmatically when needed.
    * Ping settings can now be set per blog instead of site-wise.
    * Added a Spanish translation - Thanks to Ruben!
    * Added more News languages:
        * Hebrew (he)
        * Traditional Chinese (zh-tw)
        * Arabic (ar)
        * Hindi (hi)
        * Japanese (ja)
    * Other enhancements.

* **Bugfixes**:
    * Fixed an issue that might cause an extraneous split part to appear.
    * Fixed an issue that might cause "Invalid last modified date" error
    * Fixed an issue that might cause the sitemapindex to use the regular XSLT stylesheet
    * Sitemapindex should now respect excluded posts when splitting post-based sitemaps
    * Other bugfixes.

**Important Update Note**:

* if you're using custom modules make sure that you re-read the [documentation](http://betterwp.net/wordpress-plugins/google-xml-sitemaps/#module_api) for updated info about the module API.
* When the sitemapindex is generated for the first time, you won't see any <em>Last modified date</em> for any child sitemaps because none of them have been generated yet. This is expected and adhered to the <a href="http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html#sitemapIndexTagDefinitions">official sitemap protocol</a>.

== Upgrade Notice ==

Nothing here.
